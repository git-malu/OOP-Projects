Hello,
If you run the program, a window will pop up.
In the north panel, there is a text field where you can type the ball name here, after that you can press the "Make Ball" button, the ball you want will display in center.
If you type "StraightBall" and press the "Make Ball" button, a normal ball without special behavior will display.
If you type "SizeBall" and press the "Make Ball" button, a ball that could change radius will display.
If you type "ColorBall" and press the "Make Ball" button, a ball that could change color will display.
If you type "SpinBall" and press the "Make Ball" button, a ball that could spin will display.
If you press the "Clean Balls" button, all balls will disappear.

The center panel is a zone for painting, where there are balls moving, bouncing and showing all kinds of special behavior.

Thank you for reading.
