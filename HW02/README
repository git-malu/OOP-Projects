Hello,
If you run the program, a window will pop up.
In the north panel, there is a "text field" where you can type whatever text that will be displayed in the middle "display area" once you click the "click here"" button.

The center panel is a zone for painting, where there is initially a red oval and an arc painted.

In the south panel, there are four buttons named "Rect", "Arc", "RoundRect", "A House" separately.
These four buttons paint shapes that they are named respectively. 
For example, when you click "rect" button, a rectangle will be painted. And A house when "A House" is clicked.

Thank you for reading.
